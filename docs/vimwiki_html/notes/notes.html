<div id="Linear Effects"><h1 id="Linear Effects">Linear Effects</h1></div>
<p>
In an effort to understand the results that we see with the real data
and the disparity in performance relative to the mock data, I decided to
look first at more simple, linear correlations between the channels and
DARM. The results, <em>I think</em> are a clear presentation showing why this
noise cancellation is a difficult task and demonstrates, at least to some
degree, what kind of subtraction we can expect to get.
</p>

<div id="Linear Effects-Data Comparison"><h2 id="Data Comparison">Data Comparison</h2></div>
<p>
First, I wanted to simply look at each witness channel and compare it to
DARM to see if there were common features that would allow us to "easily"
predict the DARM spectrum based on those channels. In the case of the mock
data, the answer is a definite "yes."
</p>

<div id="Linear Effects-Data Comparison-Mock Data"><h3 id="Mock Data">Mock Data</h3></div>
<p>
There is very clear structure here. There was obviously an attempt to bury it
in noise, but it's more than enough for the NN to figure it out.
</p>

</p>


<div id="Linear Effects-Data Comparison-Real Data"><h3 id="Real Data">Real Data</h3></div>
<p>
There is much less structure here. I would submit that it isn't clear that a
purely linear regression would do very well.

</p>


<div id="Linear Effects-Using MSE to Predict DARM"><h2 id="Using MSE to Predict DARM">Using MSE to Predict DARM</h2></div>
<p>
I next wanted to look at how well the channels could predict DARM by doing
Wiener filtering essentially. I start with the MSE cost function
</p>

<p>
\(J(w) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( X_j^{(i)}\cdot w^j -y^{(i)}\right)^2\)
</p>

<p>
and then take the gradient and set it to zero. Solving that equation for the
weights \(w\) I get
</p>

<p>
\(\frac{\partial }{\partial w_k} J(w) = 0 \longrightarrow w = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y\)
</p>

<p>
Since \(X\) is just my "feature" matrix and \(y\) is DARM, I can easily calculate
this (depending on how invertible the term in parenthesis is). I did this
first for the mock data and then the real data. I don't care about the fit
as long as it's just a scaling issue. The coherence is all about the phases
so we can always rescale a reliable witness if we need to. Here what I found
</p>

<div id="Linear Effects-Using MSE to Predict DARM-Mock Results"><h3 id="Mock Results">Mock Results</h3></div>
<p>
Barring some scaling, the fit here is fantastic up to around 20Hz. The phases
are off, but this should get resolved through scaling I think.
<img src="https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~rich.ormiston/noise_cancellation/images/Mock_data_analytical.png" />
</p>

<div id="Linear Effects-Using MSE to Predict DARM-Real Results"><h3 id="Real Results">Real Results</h3></div>
<p>
This actually has decent coherence (which I can reproduct with my new NN model)
but the fit is terrible even with scaling. Some nonlinear weighting (like a NN)
could be able to fix this. The point of all this isn't to provide results
for us - this doesn't take into account a nonlinear regression. It just highlihgts
the stark differences between the real and mock data. I think it might give us <em>some</em>
idea of the kind of results that we can get though.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~rich.ormiston/noise_cancellation/images/Real_data_analytical.png" />
</p>


<div id="Results"><h1 id="Results">Results</h1></div>
<p>
The results of the new network that I built are shown here. The results are
very similar to the current network. Maybe I'm convincing myself that I see more
than there is, but I think the new one does perform slightly better. I have not
applied any filtering whatsoever - no whitening, no notching calibration lines,
nothing. I think this is part of the reason that I get these harmonics that show
up around 36, 48 and 60Hz. Eliminating those may go a long way towards making the
training a bit smoother. The new script is really nice and clean though. It makes
more sense to me anyway. I't makes model switching much easier since it's all
flags now, including the activation parameters. We could effectively write
wrapper scripts that do brute force hyperparameterization now.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<img src="https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~rich.ormiston/NonlinearRegression/docs/vimwiki/images/bilinearRegressionReal.png" />
</p>


<div id="Results-New NN Script"><h2 id="New NN Script">New NN Script</h2></div>
<p>
For the new script, I played around with the activation function tuning (I
did not do any tuning of the model atchitecture yet). Depending on what I
chose to do, I could get an interesting peak around 12Hz that is visible in
the <code>bilinearRegressionReal.py</code> script
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~rich.ormiston/NonlinearRegression/docs/wiki/images/Sharp12HzPeak.png" />
</p>

<p>
But for the most part, the results look something like the plot below.
I'm assuming that because I'm not filtering, I'm able to catch the
60Hz and 120Hz harmonics pretty strongly. It's also nice to know that
using a completely different, independent approach to the problem that
the results are so somilar. It means that we must be doing something
right.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~rich.ormiston/noise_cancellation/images/Validation-LSTM-RMSProp_Great_Loss_and_Fit.png" />
</p>

<p>
I think that this is pretty good and based off of the linear, analytical solution,
it's probably close to as good as we're going to get if those two things are
correlated. I don't know if that is necessarily true. Maybe we can do much better.
Perhaps we could try to delibrately add some nonlinearity to the model? For
example, I could take products of channels and compare those to DARM like I did above
and see if are any that contain "features" that we could use. Nominally, the NN should
be able to learn these things, so I don't know if it is really worth looking into all that
much.
</p>

<div id="Results-New NN Script-Mock Data Results"><h3 id="Mock Data Results">Mock Data Results</h3></div>
<p>
The mock data is essentially the same as before. Again, it's nice to see consistency
between different approaches.

</p>

<div id="Results-New NN Script-Loss Curves"><h3 id="Loss Curves">Loss Curves</h3></div>
<p>
Not much to say other than that things look pretty good
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~rich.ormiston/noise_cancellation/images/loss_history_comparison.png" />
</p>

<p>
Anyway, this is where things are at. I'm going to play around with some new model
architectures and see what kind of results I can get. I'm also messing around with
the normalization to see if the feature scaling makes an important difference. I'm
having Sharan make me some time series data with injections so we can verify that
we're not losing SNR after subtraction.

Hopefully this part worked for you.

This installs tensorflow (<code>pip show tensorflow</code>) with CPU support. To run on GPUs,
you should be able to just install a different tensorflow
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint language-bash">
$ source $HOME/noise_cancellation/bin/activate
$ pip uninstall tensorflow
$ pip install tensorflow-gpu
</pre>

<p>
You <em>may</em> need to export the path to the CUDA libraries in order
to use the GPUs. I can't remember if I needed to do that or not.
To set the path, do
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-bash">
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cudnn-5.1/cuda/lib64
</pre>

<p>
You can also install TF with GPU support directly from the website in case you want to get a
particular version. The pip install shown above gets you the same version as below
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-bash">
$ pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.3.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

To verify that you're indeed using GPUs, you can run <code>top</code> at the same time that you're
running one of those scripts. If your CPU usage is fairly small (under \(\sim100\%\)) then
you're using a GPU. You can <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.tensorflow.org&#47;tutorials&#47;using_gpu">run TF directly</a> and print out what it is running on if
you wanted a more explicit output.

<div id="Setting up NonlinearRegression Repo-Building Webpages"><h2 id="Building Webpages">Building Webpages</h2></div>
<p>
Making the webpages like the ones you saw should just be one command. Let's first run two
models that we wish to compare
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint language-bash">
$ python train_network.py -b 1000 --activation linear -e 50 -opt rmsprop --rho 0.4 -lr 0.001 --decay 0.5
$ python train_network.py --activation linear -e 10 -opt adadelta -lr 1 --rho 0.1 --decay 0.0 -m MLP
</pre>

<p>
One uses LSTMs and the other uses multi-layer perceptrons. Next, specify the models to
compare in the config file here: <code>$HOME/noise_cancellation/configs/configs.ini</code>. It should look
something like this
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint language-bash">
[run]
basedir = /home/rana.adhikari/git_repositories/NonlinearRegression
models  = LSTM, MLP
</pre>

<p>
You can make as many models as you want and add them here for comparison. I wouldn't add more than
three models at once otherwise the figures start getting a bit small. Now we can build the webpages
</p>

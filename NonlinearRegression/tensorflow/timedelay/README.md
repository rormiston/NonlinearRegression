# Keras - TensorFlow for Nonlinear Regression

So far we are using Dense feed-forward networks for nonlinear Regression.
```bash
python bilinearRegression.py
```
the above should work if you have cloned the 'MockData' repo in parallel to the 'NonlinearRegression' repo and have made some bilinear noise in there using makeNoise.py
